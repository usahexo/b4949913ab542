<h1 id="Where-will-Design-Furniture-amp-Accessories-2022-be-held"><a href="#Where-will-Design-Furniture-amp-Accessories-2022-be-held" class="headerlink" title="Where will Design Furniture &amp; Accessories 2022 be held?"></a>Where will Design Furniture &amp; Accessories 2022 be held?</h1><p>The Design Furniture &amp; Accessories 2022 show will be hosted at the Los Angeles Convention Center from January 9-11. The event is organized by Emerald Expositions, a trade show and conference organizer with more than three decades of experience in the industry.</p>
<p>Emerald Expositions purchased the Babies “R” Us brand in February of last year, and this will be the company’s first trade show under the new ownership. The event promises to feature over 1,000 brands and attract more than 25,000 visitors.</p>
<p>Design Furniture &amp; Accessories is a leading trade show for home furnishings and accessories. The event showcases products including sofas, chairs, tables, beds, lighting, rugs, textiles, wallpaper, and more. It also features accessories such as mirrors, clocks, vases, lamps, and art.</p>
<p>This year’s show is taking place at an important time for the home furnishings industry. Consumer spending on furniture and appliances has been steadily increasing in recent years as the economy continues to strengthen. In addition, there is growing interest in renovating homes rather than moving to new ones. This has led to increased demand for furniture and accessories that can help make old homes feel new again.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Convention Center is a convenient location for this year’s Design Furniture &amp; Accessories show. The center is close to many major highways and offers ample parking. It has also been recently renovated and now features more than 1 million square feet of exhibit space.</p>
