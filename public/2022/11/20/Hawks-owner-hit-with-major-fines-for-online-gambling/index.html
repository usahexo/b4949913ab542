<p>A statement released by the NBA on Thursday said that Ressler had been fined for violating the NBA’s anti-gambling policy. It is unclear what specific activities Ressler was involved in, but the statement said that he has acknowledged his violations and “has agreed to complete an NBA-mandated education program on the risks of gambling.”</p>
<p>Ressler bought the Hawks from Bruce Levenson in 2015. The team has been one of the worst in the league over the past few seasons, although they made a surprising run to the playoffs last year.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Hawks-to-suspend-operations-due-to-online-gambling-raids"><a href="#Atlanta-Hawks-to-suspend-operations-due-to-online-gambling-raids" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Hawks to suspend operations due to online gambling raids"></a>Atlanta Hawks to suspend operations due to online gambling raids</h1><p>The Atlanta Hawks issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the team would be suspending its operations indefinitely due to several online gambling raids that took place in the city this week.</p>
<p>According to the Hawks, the decision to suspend operations was made in order to ensure the safety of the organization’s employees and players. The statement went on to say that the team is fully cooperating with law enforcement officials in their investigation and that additional information will be released as it becomes available.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that online gambling has led to problems for an NBA team. In 2007, the Boston Celtics were forced to suspend operations for two months after several of their players were implicated in a gambling ring.</p>
<p>It is unclear how long the Hawks will be suspended for, but it is likely that the season will be cancelled altogether.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-commissioner-speaks-out-against-online-gambling-in-states-where-it-is-illegal"><a href="#NBA-commissioner-speaks-out-against-online-gambling-in-states-where-it-is-illegal" class="headerlink" title="NBA commissioner speaks out against online gambling in states where it is illegal"></a>NBA commissioner speaks out against online gambling in states where it is illegal</h1><p>In a recent memo to all NBA owners, commissioner Adam Silver spoke out against the expansion of legalized online gambling in states where it is currently illegal.</p>
<p>“We believe that the expansion of legal and regulated sports betting will protect the integrity of our game while providing our fans with an enhanced experience,” Silver wrote in the memo.</p>
<p>The NBA joins several other professional leagues in its opposition to expanded gambling, including the NFL, NHL, and MLB. However, these leagues have taken different positions on how they would like legalized gambling to be implemented.</p>
<p>The NFL has been the most vocal opponent of expanding legalized gambling, while the MLB has been more open to it with certain restrictions. The NHL is in favor of expanding legalized gambling but only if it is done in a limited way that does not affect the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>Silver argues that the NBA’s opposition is based on their concern for the “integrity of our game.” He notes that there is a significant risk of game-fixing if online gambling is allowed to spread unchecked.</p>
<p>While it is currently illegal to bet on sports games in most states, there are many people who do so anyway through offshore websites. These websites are not subject to any regulatory oversight, which makes them a potential target for corruption.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling could help address this problem by bringing these activities under the purview of regulatory agencies. It could also provide new sources of revenue for state governments, which could help offset some of the costs associated with legalizing marijuana.</p>
<p>However, Silver also points out some potential risks associated with expanded gambling. These include increased addiction rates and a rise in crime rates as addicts turn to stealing or other criminal activities in order to finance their habit.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-Hawks-caught-up-in-online-gambling-controversy"><a href="#Atlanta-Hawks-caught-up-in-online-gambling-controversy" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta Hawks caught up in online gambling controversy"></a>Atlanta Hawks caught up in online gambling controversy</h1><p>In recent news, the Atlanta Hawks have been involved in a gambling controversy. It all began when a photo surfaced on social media of Hawks forward Taurean Prince and guard Dennis Schroder online at a casino in the Dominican Republic. This led to an outcry from some fans who claimed that the players were breaking the NBA’s gambling rules.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the Hawks organization to respond to the allegations. They released a statement saying that Prince and Schroder were not gambling, but instead were only watching people play poker. The team also stated that they do not have any rules against their players visiting casinos.</p>
<p>Although Prince and Schroder have both denied that they were gambling, the fact that they were seen at a casino has raised some eyebrows. It’s unclear whether or not the NBA will investigate this further, but for now it seems like the Hawks are in the clear.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that an NBA team has been caught up in a gambling controversy. In 2007, former San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich was fined $250,000 for allegedly betting on games. And in 2009, then-Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was suspended for two games after being accused of betting on college basketball games.</p>
<p>Gambling is obviously a big issue in the NBA, and teams need to be careful not to get themselves into trouble. It will be interesting to see if Prince and Schroder are punished in any way for their visit to the casino, or if this will just blow over like other controversies have in the past.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-continues-to-be-a-thorn-in-the-side-of-the-Atlanta-Hawks"><a href="#Online-gambling-continues-to-be-a-thorn-in-the-side-of-the-Atlanta-Hawks" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling continues to be a thorn in the side of the Atlanta Hawks"></a>Online gambling continues to be a thorn in the side of the Atlanta Hawks</h1><p>Online gambling has become a major issue for the NBA and its teams, with Atlanta Hawks owner Tony Ressler among those calling for the league to address the matter.</p>
<p>Ressler is one of several team owners who have voiced their concerns about the increasing popularity of illegal gambling, which has had a negative impact on the league’s business.</p>
<p>While NBA officials have been reluctant to take any action on the matter, at least in part because of the potential legal ramifications, it appears that they are finally ready to address the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum sent a memo to team owners in which he outlined the league’s plans to crack down on online gambling.</p>
<p>The memo stated that the NBA was working with law enforcement agencies and tech companies to develop strategies to shut down illegal gambling operations. The league is also seeking to partner with state governments to legalize and regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>Tatum cautioned team owners that while there is no immediate solution to the problem, they need to be aware of the dangers of illegal gambling and take steps to protect their teams and players.</p>
<p> Hawks owner Tony Ressler welcomed the NBA’s plans, saying that it was important for the league to take a stand against illegal gambling.</p>
<p>“I applaud Commissioner Silver and Deputy Commissioner Tatum for their leadership on this vitally important issue,” said Ressler. “Illegal gambling is a scourge on our society and we must all work together - team owners, leagues, law enforcement - to eradicate it.”</p>
