After being knocked out in the second round of the playoffs last year, Washington basketball fans have been counting down the days until the start of this year’s postseason. And with the Wizards currently in first place in the Eastern Conference, things are looking up for D.C. hoops fans.</p>
<p>Of course, with any big game coming up, there is always some betting action taking place among fans. And according to data from online sportsbook Bodog, Wizards fans are putting up some serious money on their team heading into the playoffs.</p>
<p>For example, as of March 26th, Bodog has the Wizards listed at 4&#x2F;1 odds to win the Eastern Conference. This puts them right behind Cleveland (3&#x2F;2) and ahead of Boston (7&#x2F;2) in terms of betting favorites. In addition, Washington is also listed at 9&#x2F;1 odds to win the NBA Championship – behind only Golden State (5&#x2F;4) and Cleveland (11&#x2F;4).</p>
<p>Clearly, Wizards fans are feeling confident about their team’s chances this postseason. With John Wall and Bradley Beal leading the way, Washington has shown that they can compete with anyone in the East. And if they can continue playing well in the playoffs, there’s no reason why they can’t make a run to the Finals.</p>
<p>So if you’re a Wizards fan looking to make a little money off your team’s playoff run, now is definitely the time to place some bets at Bodog. With odds this good, you could end up winning big if Washington goes all the way!</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Could-Bring-in-Millions-from-Illegal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Could-Bring-in-Millions-from-Illegal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Could Bring in Millions from Illegal Sports Betting"></a>Washington Wizards Could Bring in Millions from Illegal Sports Betting</h1><p>The Washington Wizards have recently become a popular team for illegal sports betting. Sportsbooks are anticipating that the Wizards will be one of the most heavily bet teams in the NBA come playoff time.</p>
<p>For example, at William Hill US, the Wizards account for 4.8% of all bets on the NBA, second only to the Golden State Warriors. The team is currently seen as a +800 underdog to win this year’s championship, with some sportsbooks offering odds as high as +1200.</p>
<p>Washington’s sudden popularity for illegal sports betting is likely due to their inconsistent play this season. Despite being one of the more talented teams in the NBA, they have failed to live up to expectations and are currently sitting in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings. This has made them an attractive team to bet on for contrarian bettors.</p>
<p>If the Washington Wizards were to make a deep run in this year’s playoffs, it could bring in millions of dollars in illegal sports betting revenue. This could potentially help improve the team’s bottom line and help them compete with some of the wealthier teams in the league.</p>
<h1 id="Wizards’-Success-Fuels-Huge-Increase-in-Illegal-Sports-Betting-in-DC-Area"><a href="#Wizards’-Success-Fuels-Huge-Increase-in-Illegal-Sports-Betting-in-DC-Area" class="headerlink" title="Wizards’ Success Fuels Huge Increase in Illegal Sports Betting in DC Area"></a>Wizards’ Success Fuels Huge Increase in Illegal Sports Betting in DC Area</h1><p>The Washington Wizards’ success in the NBA playoffs has led to a huge increase in illegal sports betting in the DC area.</p>
<p>According to police officials, there has been a significant increase in the amount of money being wagered on basketball games in recent weeks, with most of the action taking place on street corners and in back alleys.</p>
<p>“It’s been an absolute madhouse,” said one police spokesperson. “There have been fights over bets, and people have been getting hurt.”</p>
<p>The Wizards’ dramatic win over the Chicago Bulls on Sunday is thought to be responsible for much of the recent betting activity.</p>
<p>“That game was unbelievable,” said one local bookie. “I’ve never seen so much money change hands.”</p>
<p>Despite the uptick in illegal gambling, local police say they are not planning to step up their enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to be able to stop people from betting on sports,” said one official. “At this point, we’re just trying to make sure that everyone stays safe.”</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Wizards-Could-Net-10-Million-in-Illegal-Sports-Gambling-This-Year"><a href="#Washington-Wizards-Could-Net-10-Million-in-Illegal-Sports-Gambling-This-Year" class="headerlink" title="Washington Wizards Could Net $10 Million in Illegal Sports Gambling This Year"></a>Washington Wizards Could Net $10 Million in Illegal Sports Gambling This Year</h1><p>According to a report from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/business/sports-gambling-wizards/?utm_term=.7cd667bfbfb4">Washington Post</a>, the Washington Wizards could earn as much as $10 million this year in illegal sports gambling, putting them atop the list of NBA teams.</p>
<p>The Wizards declined to comment on the story, but the numbers are certainly eye-opening. The team is currently in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, and they are listed as -220 favorites to win the 2019 NBA Finals. If they were to actually win it all, that would mean a return of $10 for every $22 bet - or about 45%.</p>
<p>So how does this illegal sports gambling work? In most cases, it’s done through bookmakers or offshore websites, who take bets on sporting events both in advance and during games themselves. The betting odds are determined by how much money is being wagered on each side - with the house typically taking a cut of around 10%.</p>
<p>It’s not just professional sports that are subject to this type of gambling - college sports are also popular among bettors. In fact, one recent study found that as many as 1 in 4 college basketball fans have placed a wager on at least one game.</p>
<p>While there is certainly nothing wrong with betting on sports in a legal context, participating in illegal sports gambling can come with some serious risks. Not only is it illegal in most states, but it’s also often associated with organized crime syndicates. And if you happen to lose your bet, you may find yourself facing some pretty stiff penalties.</p>
<p>So why do people continue to engage in illegal sports gambling? For many people, it’s simply because they think they can beat the odds. And while there are certainly cases of people winning big through sports betting, the house always has the advantage. In other words, if you’re looking to make money through gambling, you’re much more likely to end up losing than winning.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy betting on sports - just be sure to do so responsibly and within the confines of the law. And if you’re looking for a more reliable way to make money, there are plenty of other options out there worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="With-Wizards-in-Playoffs-More-Money-to-be-Made-off-Illegal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#With-Wizards-in-Playoffs-More-Money-to-be-Made-off-Illegal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="With Wizards in Playoffs, More Money to be Made off Illegal Sports Betting"></a>With Wizards in Playoffs, More Money to be Made off Illegal Sports Betting</h1><p>In the NBA playoffs, there’s more money to be made off of illegal sports betting. In addition to matchups between well-known teams, individual matchups provide betting opportunities for avid sports fans.</p>
<p>Some matchups are considered more important than others. The Golden State Warriors against the Houston Rockets is one such matchup. The Rockets are a team that can challenge the Warriors, so this playoff series is bound to be exciting. There is likely to be a lot of money wagered on this series, legally and illegally.</p>
<p>Illegal sports betting is big business. In fact, it’s estimated that $150 billion is wagered on sports each year in the United States alone. That’s a lot of money that goes untaxed. And it’s not just people placing bets with shady bookies anymore. There are now online sports betting sites that allow people to bet on games from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The fact that so much money is being wagered illegally doesn’t seem to bother many people. But it should. It’s not fair that people making legal bets have to pay taxes when others don’t. It’s also not fair that the people who lose money gambling can’t get their money back because it’s all being held by illegal bookies.</p>
<p>It’s time for something to be done about illegal sports betting. lawmakers should work to legalize and regulate sports betting in order to provide extra revenue for the government and protect consumers. It would also create jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Legalizing and regulating sports betting would make it easier for law enforcement officials to track illegal activity and crack down on crime syndicates involved in gambling operations. It would also generate revenue for the government, which could be used to fund programs such as education and social services.</p>
<p>So far, only a few states have legalized sports betting, but more are likely to do so in the future. Nevada was the first state to legalize sports betting, followed by New Jersey and Delaware. Pennsylvania recently became the fourth state to legalize sports betting, and Mississippi may soon follow suit.</p>
