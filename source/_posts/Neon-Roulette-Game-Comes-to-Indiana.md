#  Neon Roulette Game Comes to Indiana

INDIANAPOLIS, IND. - The neon lights of casino floors have always been alluring to Indiana residents, and the newest craze in gambling, the neon roulette game, is no exception.

The game is simple: Players place a bet on either red or black, then spin a wheel with 36 numbers - 18 red and 18 black. If the number that comes up matches the player's bet, they win.

Casinos are seeing a surge in attendance as people flock to try their luck at the new game. Local resident Crystal Kincaid says she's been playing regularly since the game arrived at her casino.

"I like how fast-paced it is," Kincaid says. "It's more exciting than regular roulette."

While some players are drawn to the excitement of the game, others say they find it nerve-racking.

"I hate it," local resident Jamie White says. "I always end up betting on black and losing everything."

#  Roulette Comes to Indiana with the Hard Rock Casino

The Hard Rock Casino in downtown Indianapolis is the latest to offer roulette, giving Hoosiers another gambling option.

The casino, which opened in late September, has 29 table games and nearly 1,500 slot machines. Roulette is one of several new table games, including Spanish 21 and three card poker.

“We are very excited about the addition of roulette to our gaming floor,” said Mike Sacco, president of Hard Rock Casino Indianapolis. “This game has been a hit at other casinos across the country and we believe it will be equally popular here.”

Roulette is a popular gambling game that originated in France in the 18th century. The game is played on a circular table with a spinning wheel numbered from 0 to 36. Players bet on which section of the wheel the ball will end up in after the spin. Wins are paid out based on the odds of that particular bet.

Roulette has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks in part to its exposure on television shows like “The Office” and “The Good Wife”.

The Hard Rock Casino is located at 7900 W. Washington St.
