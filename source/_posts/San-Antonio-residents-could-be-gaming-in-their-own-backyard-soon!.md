#  San Antonio residents could be gaming in their own backyard soon!

San Antonio is home to a new gaming park that is expected to open in late summer of 2019. The $11 million park, known as “ simply Gaming” will be located just south of downtown and north of the airport. The 100,000 square-foot park will include an arcade, virtual reality experiences, miniature golf, and a restaurant/bar.

The arcade will feature classics like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, but also more modern games like Halo and Call of Duty. Danny Seaman, the spokesperson for Simply Gaming, stated that they plan on having something for everyone at their park. He went on to say that they are expecting around 500,000 visitors a year.

The VR experiences will allow players to step into other worlds and do things like fly through the sky or battle zombies. There will also be a “laser tag arena” where players can use lasers to shoot each other dead. And for those who love puttingt-putt golf in their backyard, this place has you covered with an 18-hole miniature golf course.

But what would any good gaming park be without food? The Simply Gaming restaurant/bar will have plenty of options for both gamers and non-gamers alike. They will serve up pizza, burgers, chicken tenders, hot dogs, soft drinks and beer (for those 21+).

With San Antonio’s Simply Gaming park opening soon, residents in the area now have a new place to go for some fun family entertainment. This Park looks like it will have something for everyone so it’s sure to be a hit!

#  Excitement in the air as San Antonio gets ready for its first casino!

In an age where casinos seem to be springing up all over the place, it’s not too surprising that one is finally coming to San Antonio. Excitement is already in the air as people get ready for the grand opening, which is scheduled for early next year.

The new casino, which has been code-named “Project X”, will be located on the north side of town and is expected to bring in hundreds of jobs as well as millions of dollars in revenue. It will feature a mix of gaming options, including slot machines, table games, and poker rooms. There will also be a high-end restaurant, several bars, and a hotel with hundreds of rooms.

City officials are hoping that the casino will help to revitalize the north side of town, which has been struggling in recent years. They also believe that it will attract tourists from all over Texas and beyond, who will come to enjoy the gambling and entertainment options available there.

There has been some opposition to the casino, mostly from residents who live near the proposed location. They argue that it will bring crime and traffic congestion to the neighborhood, and they warn that it could have a negative impact on property values. However, city officials remain confident that the casino will be a boon for San Antonio.

Project X is scheduled to open in early 2019. In the meantime, be sure to stay tuned for more updates!
