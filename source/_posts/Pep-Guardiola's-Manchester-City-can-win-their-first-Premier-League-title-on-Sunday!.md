#  Pep Guardiola's Manchester City can win their first Premier League title on Sunday!

# Manchester City have won the Premier League with 5 games to spare, and could clinch the title on Sunday at home to Tottenham Hotspur!

Pep Guardiola's side have been in fantastic form all season, and currently lead the table by a healthy margin. In addition to their Premier League campaign, Manchester City have also reached the FA Cup final and are still in contention for Champions League glory.

The Citizens have benefitted from a number of excellent players this season, including Kevin De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero and David Silva. However, it has been captain Vincent Kompany who has arguably been the team's most important player. The Belgian defender has been an inspirational figure both on and off the pitch, and has been one of the main reasons why Manchester City have been so successful this season.

Guardiola will be hoping to lead his side to victory on Sunday against Tottenham Hotspur, and with the likes of De Bruyne and Aguero in such good form, it is certainly possible. If Manchester City can win their final 5 games of the season, they will be crowned Premier League champions!

#  Manchester City break Premier League record with 18th consecutive victory

Manchester City set a new Premier League record with their 18th consecutive victory, beating Everton 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium.

Pep Guardiola's side had looked set to Match Arsenal's record of 19 matches unbeaten set in 2002, but they were surprisingly held to a 2-2 draw by Crystal Palace last weekend.

However, they responded in emphatic fashion this afternoon, with goals from David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane securing all three points for the home side.

Everton actually took an early lead through Wayne Rooney, but after Silva's equaliser, Aguero and Sane both scored before half time to make the game safe.

The result means that Manchester City are now two points clear of second-placed Liverpool at the top of the table, and they will be looking to extend their record winning streak when they travel to Newcastle next weekend.

#  Manchester City could be set to become the first team ever to win the quadruple

Manchester City have already won the Premier League, League Cup and FA Cup this season, and they could make history by becoming the first team ever to win the quadruple.

Their form in the Premier League has been incredible, and they currently sit 11 points clear of second-placed Liverpool with just seven games remaining.

They have also been impressive in the Champions League, and they are currently top of their group with five wins from six games.

If they can win their final group game against Shakhtar Donetsk, they will be guaranteed a place in the knockout stages of the competition.

City have also been very strong in the FA Cup and League Cup this season, and they could end up winning all four competitions.

 Pep Guardiola is a masterful manager, and he has moulded this City team into one of the best in world football.

The likes of Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva are all world-class players, and they have been instrumental in City's success this season.

In addition to these players, Guardiola also has a number of talented youngsters at his disposal, including Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus.

Guardiola has shown that he is not afraid to give young players a chance, and this bodes well for the future of Manchester City.

City are definitely one of the favourites to win the Champions League this season, and they will be determined to go all the way and win Europe's biggest prize.

Guardiola is a serial winner, and he will be desperate to add Champions League glory to his trophy cabinet.

#  Sergio Aguero scores hat-trick as Manchester City reach FA Cup final

In the first semi-final of the 2017-2018 season, Manchester City hosted Championship side Brighton. This FA Cup fixture was always going to be a difficult match for the Premier League side, but their star striker Sergio Aguero ensured that they progressed to the final.

Aguero got his team off to a great start, scoring in the 6th minute after a neat one-two with Raheem Sterling. The Argentine doubled Man City’s lead in the 25th minute with an unstoppable shot from 25 yards out. Brighton pulled one back shortly before halftime through Glenn Murray, but Aguero restored Manchester City’s two-goal advantage with another brilliant strike just after the break.

The hat-trick was complete in the 71st minute when Aguero met a cross from Kevin De Bruyne and headed the ball past Brighton keeper Mat Ryan. This result means that Manchester City will face either Chelsea or Southampton in the final at Wembley Stadium in May.

#  Manchester City crowned Champions League winners

Manchester City have been crowned champions of the Champions League after a 6-1 aggregate win over Liverpool in the semi-final and a 1-0 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the final. Pep Guardiola’s side were by far the better team over the two legs and fully deserved their title, becoming the first English club to win Europe’s top prize twice.

It was a case of so near yet so far for Liverpool, who were brilliant for much of the season but ultimately came up short against a City side that seem to be getting better and better. The Reds can take consolation from reaching their first Champions League final since 2007, but they will be bitterly disappointed not to have won it all.

Tottenham did well to reach the final having started their campaign in the group stages, but they never looked like beating Manchester City and can only hope to do better next year. Mauricio Pochettino’s men have made great strides in recent years but they are still some way short of being contenders for Europe’s top prize.

For Manchester City, the Champions League victory is the culmination of a period of sustained success under Guardiola. The Spaniard has now won eight trophies in just four seasons at the Etihad Stadium, and he shows no signs of slowing down. With rumours abound that he could be set to leave Manchester City at the end of this season, it will be interesting to see if he can go one step further and win Europe’s biggest prize with his current club.
