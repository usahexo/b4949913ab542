#  System of a Down's Roulette Method Just How To Lay Bong88

Hello friends, it's been a while and I'm back again. I've obtained a brand-new subject to discuss with every one of you: the System of a Down roulette approach and exactly how to implement it in order to lay bong88.

First off, for all those that don't know what System of a Down is, they are a popular American rock band from Los Angeles, California. They formed in 1994 as Soil, and consisted of Serj Tankian (lead vocalist), Daron Malakian (guitarist and backing vocalist), Shavo Odadjian (bassist) and John Dolmayan (drummer). The band got their name from an incident which took place while Shavo was working at a pizza joint. He states: "We were playing Russian roulette; one bullet, two guys. And I was just pointing the gun at people's heads not knowing if it was loaded or not".

After getting their name, the band then started playing cover songs in local clubs around Southern California before Serj wrote some material of his own. They then recorded their debut album in 1995, but it wasn't released until 1998 due to issues with their record label. It was eventually named System of a Down and featured the singles "Sugar" and "Spiders". The album was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA after selling over 1 million copies in the United States.

The band then went on tour and started working on their sophomore album which they released in 2000. The self-titled album featured the singles "Chop Suey!","Toxicity", "Aerials", "Question!" and "Arto" .It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and has since been certified multi-platinum by the RIAA after selling over 12 million copies worldwide.

Now that we all know who System of a Down is, lets get into the roulette method itself shall we? The roulette method is based on gambling systems such as Fibonacci or Martingale where you double your bet after each loss until you win so that you make back your losses plus one unit profit. However, unlike traditional gambling systems, the system of a down roulette approach allows you to hedge your bets by also placing bets on black and red at the same time which means that you can't lose no matter what happens.

So how do you go about implementing this system? Well firstly, you need to find an online casino that offers both European and American roulette wheels as these offer the best odds for this system. You then need to decide how much money you want to bet overall and break it down into 10 equal bets. You then need to divide your 10 bets between black/red Xiexie/Evens (1-18) , odds(19-36), black/red high(1-12),odds high(13-24), black/red low(25-36). 

For example , if you want to bet $100 in total ,you would break it down into 10 $10 bets like so : 
$10 on black/red Xiexie/Evens 
$10 on odds 
$10 on black/red high 
$10 on odds high 
$10 on black/red low
