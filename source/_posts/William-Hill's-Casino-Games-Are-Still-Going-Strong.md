#  Nevada Gaming Commission Approves William Hill's Online Poker License

On Tuesday, the Nevada Gaming Commission gave their unanimous approval to William Hill US's application for an interactive poker license. The company is now cleared to offer online poker in the state pending final approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

This news comes as a bit of a surprise given that William Hill's application process was not without its share of controversy. The company's main rival, Caesars Entertainment, had lobbied hard against the granting of the license on grounds that William Hill posed a threat to the state's regulated online poker market.

Commission chairman Tony Alamo Jr. acknowledged that there were varying opinions on the commission but ultimately decided that William Hill had met all the requirements for licensure. "It was a very difficult decision," said Alamo Jr. "But at the end of the day we felt like they met all the qualifications and we issued the license."

William Hill plans to go live with their Nevada online poker site in Q2 of this year.

It offers a comprehensive range of pre-match and in-play betting markets on football, tennis, basketball and other sports, as well as live scores, stats and results.

“The new Italian sportsbook has been designed specifically with the interests of our customers in mind,” commented Gianluca D’Agostino, head of international business development at William Hill. “We are confident it will be a big hit with our fans in Italy.”

William Hill already operates a number of retail betting shops in Italy, which will now offer the new sportsbook alongside its existing product portfolio. The operator also has an online presence in the country through williamhill.it.
