#  Clippers and Lakers Tie in Historic Matchup

The Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers faced off in a historic matchup on Sunday, November 18th. The game marked the first time in NBA history that two teams from the same city faced each other with records of 9-0.

Both teams put on a show for the fans in attendance, with both sides scoring over 100 points. Ultimately, it was the Clippers who emerged victorious, tying the Lakers’ record with a 101-96 victory.

Although both teams are off to hot starts this season, there is no doubt that this game will be remembered as one of the most important in Clippers history. This matchup was not only a battle between two rivals, but also a battle between two of the best teams in the NBA.

The Clippers now look ahead to their next challenge, as they prepare to take on the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night.

#  What Does a Tie Mean in Blackjack?

In Blackjack, a tie is when both the player and the dealer have the same hand value. This happens when both players have the same number of cards, or when both players have the same total point value for their cards.

When a tie occurs, neither player wins and no money is exchanged. This can be an advantageous situation for the player, as they do not lose any money in this situation.

There are a few important things to keep in mind when it comes to ties in blackjack. First of all, if you are playing with multiple decks of cards, the likelihood of a tie increases. This is because there are more opportunities for hands to match up when there are more decks of cards being used.

Secondly, in some versions of blackjack, such as Spanish 21, ties result in a push rather than a loss. This means that no money is exchanged and players simply keep their bets intact.

#  Clippers Salvage Tie Against Lakers

The Los Angeles Lakers entered Staples Center on Wednesday night looking to avenge their earlier season loss to the LA Clippers. However, things didn’t go as planned for the home team as they only managed to score 92 points, while the Clippers had 107.

LeBron James led the Lakers in scoring with 25 points, while rookie Lonzo Ball had 8 points, 8 rebounds and 8 assists. Unfortunately, it was not enough to overcome Lou Williams and Danilo Gallinari who each scored 27 points for the Clippers.

With both teams vying for a playoff spot, this matchup was important for both sides. The Lakers are now 35-44 on the season and sit in 10th place in the Western Conference, while the Clippers are now 43-36 and sit in eighth place.

If the playoffs started today, these two teams would face each other in the first round. However, there is still over a month of basketball left to be played and plenty can change between now and then.

#  Blackjack Ties: What Happens Next?

If you’ve ever played blackjack, you’re probably familiar with the term “push.” This occurs when both the player and dealer have the same hand value, resulting in neither winning nor losing money. In most blackjack games,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) a push results in the player getting their money back.

However, there are some variations of blackjack in which a push does not result in a tie. Instead, the player loses half of their bet. This is known as “even money” blackjack.

In order to understand what happens when there is a push in even money blackjack, it’s important to first understand how the game is played. In even money blackjack, the player and dealer are both dealt two cards. The player then has the option of either hitting or standing. If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose regardless of what the dealer does. If the player has a total of 21, they automatically win unless the dealer also has 21. In all other cases, the highest total wins; for example, if the player has a total of 19 and the dealer has a total of 18, the player would win.

If both the player and dealer have identical hands (e.g., two kings), this is considered a push and neither side wins or loses money. However, in even money blackjack, if there is a push then the player loses half of their bet instead of getting their money back like in most other variants of blackjack. This makes the game slightly less favourable for players, but it also increases simplicity and reduces ties overall.

So what happens if you have a push in even money blackjack? Essentially, your bet gets cut in half and you get your money back. For example, if you bet $10 and there is a push, you would end up getting $5 back rather than keeping your full $10 bet.

#  Clippers, Lakers End in a Tie

In what was a matchup of the two most storied franchises in the NBA, the Clippers and Lakers ended in a 107-107 tie.

Both teams had their opportunities to win down the stretch, but it was ultimately a missed jumper by Lou Williams that resulted in the game ending in a draw.

Clippers’ guard Patrick Beverley led all players with 26 points on 9-of-14 shooting, while Lakers’ forward LeBron James notched his second triple-double of the season with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.

It was an entertaining game to say the least, and both sides will undoubtedly be eager to come out on top when they meet again later this season.
