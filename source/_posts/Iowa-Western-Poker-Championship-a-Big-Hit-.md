#  Iowa Western Poker Championship a Big Hit 

The Iowa Western Poker Championship was a big hit last month. Hundreds of players turned out for the event, which was held in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

The tournament offered a prize pool of $100,000, and the winner took home a cool $40,000. The final table was a star-studded affair, featuring some of the best poker players in the world.

In the end, it was veteran player John Racener who emerged victorious. Racener is a five-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner, and he showed his skills by outlasting his opponents at the final table.

This was Racener's first major victory since 2010, and it will no doubt be a boost to his confidence as he gears up for this year's WSOP.
