#  Anna Claims Bingo Connecticut is Rigged

A Connecticut woman is facing criminal charges after she allegedly rigged a bingo game to ensure her repeated wins.

Police say Anna has been playing bingo at the same senior center for years, and has always managed to come out on top. Officials began investigating earlier this year after other players complained that Anna's winning streak was too good to be true.

Investigators eventually determined that Anna was using a hidden device to mark her cards with winners, allowing her to take home the jackpot every time. She has since been arrested and charged with cheating at bingo.

This isn't the first time someone has been caught rigging a bingo game. In 2012, an 84-year-old woman in Florida was accused of using invisible ink to mark her cards.

#  Anna Claims She was Cheated Out of her Winnings

A woman who said she won a $1 million jackpot at a Pennsylvania casino has filed a lawsuit claiming the casino withheld the money after discovering she had cheated.

Anna, who declined to give her last name, said she was playing penny slots at the Meadows Racetrack and Casino in November when she hit the jackpot.

The casino, however, said an investigation revealed Anna had been cheating by using a Braille card to track the slot machine's movements.

"We are disappointed that someone tried to cheat the system," Meadows spokeswoman Carolyndragging told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. "The gaming commission requires that we withhold winnings when we suspect cheating."

Anna denies cheating and said she has never even seen a Braille card. She is suing for the return of her winnings, plus interest and attorney fees.

#  Anna Calls for an Investigation Into Bingo Connecticut

In the wake of allegations that bingo halls in the state of Connecticut are being used for money laundering, State Senator Anna submitted a formal request to the state government for an investigation into the matter.

According to Anna, several bingo halls have been shut down in recent months due to suspected money laundering activities, and more must be done to get to the bottom of the issue.

“It’s important that we get to the bottom of this and find out what is really going on in these bingo halls,” Anna said in a statement. “The people of Connecticut deserve to know that their tax dollars are not being used to fund criminal activities.”

The senator also expressed concern about the potential negative impact on legitimate bingo hall operators in the state.

“I am concerned that the actions of a few bad actors could damage the reputation of all of the legitimate bingo hall operators in Connecticut,” she said. “We need to make sure that those businesses can continue to operate lawfully and contribute to our economy.”

State officials have not yet announced any plans to investigate the matter further.

#  State Officials Respond to Anna's Allegations

Governor Tom and Attorney General Roy have both released statements in response to the allegations made against the state by Anna.

Governor Tom said, "I am confident that any allegations of wrongdoing by state officials will be found to be without merit. We will work diligently to clear our names and ensure that justice is served."

Attorney General Roy said, "We take any accusations of wrongdoing seriously, and we will investigate these allegations fully. We are committed to ensuring that the people of this state are protected from harm, and we will not tolerate any wrong doing by state officials."
