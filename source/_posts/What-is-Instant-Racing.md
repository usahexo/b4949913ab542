#  What is Instant Racing?

Instant racing is a type of pari-mutuel betting game that allows players to bet on the outcome of previously run horse races. The races can be from anywhere in the world, and players can bet on any combination of horses they choose.

# What are the odds?

The odds are determined by the total amount of money wagered on each horse, as well as the track's takeout rate. This varies from track to track, but is typically around 15-20%.

# How do I play?

To play, first you need to select the race(s) you'd like to bet on. You can then place your bets by selecting the horses you think will finish in first, second, and third place. You can also bet on horses to finish "in the money" (meaning they'll finish in one of the top three spots), or you can bet on them to win the race.

# What are the payouts?

The payouts vary depending on how much money is wagered on each horse and which horses actually finish in first, second, and third place. However, as a general rule of thumb, you'll usually receive about 8-10 times your original bet if your horse finishes in first place. If your horse comes in second or third, your payouts will be considerably lower - usually around 1-3 times your original bet.
